## Description

I made the functionality of the page better for mobile devices and I also fixed the header problem where when you clicked it, it wouldn't take you right to that section on the page. I also revised the remaining code to make sure everything was correct.


## Installation

The only things you will need to be able to access my project is a computer and access to the internet. You simply click the link of my website and it takes you right to it!
